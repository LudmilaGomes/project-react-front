## About the Project

With the goal of learning ReactJS and practicing the use of NodeJS, I decided to put the project idea into practice using these technologies.
Biblioteca Virtual is a system that manipulates and manages the data of a fictional library, storing information about books, users, sellers, fines, and loans.
