# Project | Biblioteca Virtual

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Project

<p>With the goal of learning ReactJS and practicing the use of NodeJS, I decided to put the project idea into practice using these technologies.</p>
<p>Biblioteca Virtual is a system that manipulates and manages the data of a fictional library, storing information about books, users, sellers, fines, and loans.</p>
